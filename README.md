# Personal-Projects
Personal projects which I felt inspired to create

AI 2048 Python - My personal favorite. This project was inspired by my algorithmic approach to the popular mobile game 2048. It has not only bested my high score but can also regularly beat the human world record for the game as well. I approached the algorithm following a score-based heuristic combined with a modified breadth first search that accomodated the random nature of new numbers appearing.

AI Mold - a personal favorite project that uses pygame to simulate the natural behavior of slime mold. The code was inspired by Conway's Game of Life which I found very interesting. I wanted to create a project that explored cellular automata and explore the concept that a  a cluster of very "dumb" cells can operate intelligently and search for food.

hAIngman - another favorite. This project is the perfect Hangman guesser and I frequently used it to impress new students of mine. It uses a simple algorithm to guess your chosen word from the word list associated with it. Test it here-> https://repl.it/@moseshoward18/hAIngman
